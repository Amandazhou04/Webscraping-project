# Webscraping-project

#### Project Overview  

As a data analyst in a medium-sized recruitment agency in Singapore, the task here is to conduct a web scraping data analysis to automatically extract job posting data from job posting sites. In this project, the information is scrapped from [jobstreet](https://sg.jobstreet.com/). This feature can be easily adapted to scrap other job posting sites by updating the URL in the code.
